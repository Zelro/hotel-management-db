# Hotel Management Database System

A fully structured relational database system for managing hotel operations, built using **MySQL**.
This project demonstrates database design, normalization, stored procedures, triggers, and analytical queries in a real-world hospitality scenario.

---

## Project Overview

This database system manages:

* Guest registration and preferences
* Room and room type management
* Reservations and bookings
* Hotel services and service usage tracking
* Billing and payments
* Staff management
* Automated charge calculations via triggers
* Analytical reporting queries

The project follows professional database organization and modular SQL structure.

### Folder Descriptions

* **schema/** → Database and table creation scripts
* **data/** → Sample dataset for testing
* **procedures/** → Stored procedures for reservations, billing, and services
* **triggers/** → Automated business logic triggers
* **analytics/** → Reporting and analytical SQL queries

## Technologies Used

* MySQL
* SQL (DDL, DML, Stored Procedures, Triggers)
* Relational Database Design (3NF normalization)

---

## Installation & Setup

### Step 1 — Create the Database Schema

Run:

```sql
SOURCE schema/schema.sql;
```

This creates the database and all tables.

---

### Step 2 — Insert Sample Data

Run:

```sql
SOURCE data/sample_data.sql;
```

This loads test data into the database.

---

### Step 3 — Load Stored Procedures

Run:

```sql
SOURCE procedures/hotel_reservation_procedures.sql;
```

---

### Step 4 — Load Triggers

Run:

```sql
SOURCE triggers/hotel_triggers.sql;
```

---

### Step 5 — Run Analytics (Optional)

Run:

```sql
SOURCE analytics/hotel_db_analytics.sql;
```

---

## Key Features

### Reservation Management

* Create and update reservations
* Handle guest preferences automatically

### Service Booking System

* Book and cancel hotel services
* Track service usage duration

### Automated Billing

* Trigger-based charge calculation
* Dynamic bill updates when services complete

### Stored Procedures

Includes procedures for:

* Reservation handling
* Service booking
* Billing generation
* Payment processing

### Triggers

* Auto-calculates service charges
* Automatically updates bills

---

## Database Design

The schema follows:

* Third Normal Form (3NF)
* Foreign key constraints
* InnoDB storage engine
* Referential integrity enforcement

Entities include:

* Guests
* Reservations
* Rooms
* Services
* Billing
* Staff
* Service Usage

---

## Testing the System

Example test queries:

```sql
CALL GenerateBill(1);
CALL BookService(1, 2, 1);
SELECT * FROM reservation;
SELECT * FROM bill;
```

---

## Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

* Relational schema design
* SQL modularization
* Stored procedure logic
* Trigger automation
* Data integrity management
* Real-world database architecture
